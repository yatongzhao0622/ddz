## Current Status
**Phase**: ✅ ALL CREATIVE PHASES COMPLETE - Ready for Implementation
**Focus**: Phase 1 Foundation Setup with complete design specifications
**Complexity**: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature) Project

## Current Priorities

### ✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive Planning
- **Requirements Analysis**: Complete documentation of all core requirements

- **Technology Validation**: Full stack selection and validation plan ready
- **Creative Phase Identification**: 3 creative phases flagged (Architecture, UI/UX, Algorithm)
- **Phased Implementation**: 4-phase strategy with detailed task breakdowns

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS (Phase 1 - Foundation)

**Priority Order:**
1. **Monorepo Structure** → `turbo init` + pnpm workspace configuration
2. **Client Setup** → Next.js 14 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Redux
3. **Server Setup** → Express + Socket.IO + MongoDB + Redis connections
4. **Development Workflow** → Hot reloading, scripts, build validation

**Expected Timeline**: 2-3 hours for complete foundation setup

### 🔄 UPCOMING PHASES

**Phase 2**: Core Systems (User auth + Room management) - Level 3
**Phase 3**: Real-time Integration (Socket.IO infrastructure) - Level 3  
**Phase 4**: Game Logic (Dou Dizhu implementation) - Level 3

## Key Implementation Insights

### Technology Architecture
- **Monorepo Pattern**: Turbo + pnpm for workspace coordination
- **Full TypeScript**: Strong typing throughout client and server
- **Real-time First**: Socket.IO as primary communication method
- **Functional Approach**: FP patterns preferred over OOP (user requirement)

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Real-time Performance**: Sub-100ms latency requirement
2. **State Synchronization**: Server-authoritative game state management
3. **Connection Resilience**: Graceful handling of network issues
4. **Game Rule Accuracy**: Complete Dou Dizhu rule implementation

│   └── common/
│       ├── SocketConnection.tsx
│       ├── LoadingSpinner.tsx
│       └── ErrorBoundary.tsx
```

#### State Management
```typescript
// Redux store structure
interface RootState {
  auth: {
    user: User | null;
    token: string | null;
    status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'authenticated' | 'error';
  };
  rooms: {
    list: Room[];
    currentRoom: Room | null;
    status: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'error';
  };
  game: {
    session: GameSession | null;
    players: Player[];
    status: GameStatus;
  };
  socket: {
    connected: boolean;
    lastError: string | null;
  };
}
```

#### Real-time Integration
```typescript
// Socket.IO event handling
const socketMiddleware = (socket: Socket) => (store: Store) => (next: Dispatch) => (action: Action) => {
  if (action.type === 'socket/connect') {
    socket.connect();
  }
  if (action.type === 'socket/disconnect') {
    socket.disconnect();
  }
  if (action.meta?.socket) {
    socket.emit(action.meta.event, action.payload);
  }
  return next(action);
};
```
