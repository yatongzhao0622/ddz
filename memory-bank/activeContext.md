# Active Context - ÊñóÂú∞‰∏ªÂú®Á∫øÊ∏∏Êàè

## Current Status
**Phase**: ‚úÖ ALL CREATIVE PHASES COMPLETE - Ready for Implementation
**Focus**: Phase 1 Foundation Setup with complete design specifications
**Complexity**: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature) Project

## Current Priorities

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Comprehensive Planning
- **Requirements Analysis**: Complete documentation of all core requirements
- **Component Analysis**: All 6 major components identified and mapped
- **Technology Validation**: Full stack selection and validation plan ready
- **Creative Phase Identification**: 3 creative phases flagged (Architecture, UI/UX, Algorithm)
- **Phased Implementation**: 4-phase strategy with detailed task breakdowns

### üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS (Phase 1 - Foundation)

**Priority Order:**
1. **Monorepo Structure** ‚Üí `turbo init` + pnpm workspace configuration
2. **Client Setup** ‚Üí Next.js 14 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Redux
3. **Server Setup** ‚Üí Express + Socket.IO + MongoDB + Redis connections
4. **Development Workflow** ‚Üí Hot reloading, scripts, build validation

**Expected Timeline**: 2-3 hours for complete foundation setup

### üîÑ UPCOMING PHASES

**Phase 2**: Core Systems (User auth + Room management) - Level 3
**Phase 3**: Real-time Integration (Socket.IO infrastructure) - Level 3  
**Phase 4**: Game Logic (Dou Dizhu implementation) - Level 3

## Key Implementation Insights

### Technology Architecture
- **Monorepo Pattern**: Turbo + pnpm for workspace coordination
- **Full TypeScript**: Strong typing throughout client and server
- **Real-time First**: Socket.IO as primary communication method
- **Functional Approach**: FP patterns preferred over OOP (user requirement)

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Real-time Performance**: Sub-100ms latency requirement
2. **State Synchronization**: Server-authoritative game state management
3. **Connection Resilience**: Graceful handling of network issues
4. **Game Rule Accuracy**: Complete Dou Dizhu rule implementation
