   - Set up development scripts

2. **Client Application Setup** (Level 2)
   - Initialize Next.js with TypeScript
   - Configure TailwindCSS
   - Set up Redux store
   - Install socket.io-client

3. **Server Application Setup** (Level 2)
   - Initialize Express with TypeScript
   - Configure Socket.IO server
   - Set up MongoDB connection with Mongoose
   - Configure Redis connection with ioredis
   - Set up JWT authentication middleware

4. **User System Implementation** (Level 3)
   - Create user registration/login API
   - Build login page UI
   - Implement route protection
   - Set up automatic redirects

5. **Room System Implementation** (Level 3)
   - Build room management API
   - Create room list UI
   - Implement Socket.IO room events
   - Add player ready/unready system

## Component Implementation Status

### User System Components
- **Frontend**
  - [ ] Route protection logic
  - [ ] Login page (`/login`)
  - [ ] Automatic redirect handling
- **Backend**  
  - [ ] `GET /user-info` endpoint
  - [ ] `POST /login` endpoint
  - [ ] `POST /regist` endpoint
  - [ ] `POST /logout` endpoint

### Room System Components
- **Frontend**
  - [ ] Main page (`/`) with room list
  - [ ] Room page (`/room/:roomId`) with game interface
  - [ ] Room creation UI
  - [ ] Player status display
- **Backend**
  - [ ] Socket.IO room join/leave events
  - [ ] Room creation and management
  - [ ] Player ready/unready events
  - [ ] Game start event handling

### Game System Components
- **Core Game Logic**
  - [ ] Game session creation
  - [ ] Card deck and distribution
  - [ ] Player state management
  - [ ] Game phase transitions
  - [ ] Real-time state synchronization

## Development Notes
- **Approach**: Start with basic structure, then layer in features
- **Testing Strategy**: Manual testing during development, automated tests later
- **Performance**: Focus on Socket.IO optimization for real-time performance
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error boundaries and fallbacks

## Blocked Items
- None currently - ready to proceed with implementation

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Development environment fully functional
- [ ] All core APIs responding correctly
- [ ] Real-time communication working smoothly
- [ ] User flow from login to game room working
- [ ] Basic game session creation successful
